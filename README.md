WineGlassClient
===============

Cordova / JS-based client app for taking pictures of wine, uploading to the server, and [eventually] receiving recommendations on highlighted bottles

# Installation

You will probably have to run:
``cordova platform add android``
``cordova plugin add org.apache.cordova.camera`

You might also have to create the *platforms* and *plugins* directories first
